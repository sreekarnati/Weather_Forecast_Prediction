🌧️ Weather Forecast Classifier
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on binary classification to predict the likelihood of Rain based on various atmospheric conditions. The analysis compares the performance of a linear model (Logistic Regression) against an ensemble model (Random Forest Classifier) to determine the most effective method for short-term weather forecasting.

The entire analysis, including data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation, is documented in the Weather_Forecast.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
